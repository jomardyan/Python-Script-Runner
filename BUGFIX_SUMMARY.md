# Bug Fix Summary - Release Script

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Running `bash release.sh prepare-release` or `bash release.sh publish` without a version argument caused an "unbound variable" error due to `set -euo pipefail` and accessing `$2` when it wasn't provided.

**Error Message**:
```
release.sh: line 1430: $2: unbound variable
```

## Root Cause

The script uses `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling. The `-u` flag treats unset variables as errors. When commands like `prepare-release` and `publish` were called without arguments, accessing `$2` directly caused the script to fail.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed release.sh Script

Changed all command argument references from `"$2"` to `"${2:-}"` to provide a default empty string when the argument is not provided:

**Before**:
```bash
prepare-release)
    cmd_prepare_release "$2"
    ;;
publish)
    cmd_publish "$2"
    ;;
```

**After**:
```bash
prepare-release)
    cmd_prepare_release "${2:-}"
    ;;
publish)
    cmd_publish "${2:-}"
    ;;
```

This allows the functions to properly handle the missing argument and show helpful error messages instead of crashing.

### 2. Updated RELEASE_TUTORIAL.md

**Before** (Incorrect):
```bash
bash release.sh bump patch        # Step 1: Auto-bump version
bash release.sh prepare-release   # Step 2: Create release tag ❌ Missing version!
bash release.sh publish           # Step 3: Push to GitHub ❌ Missing version!
```

**After** (Correct):
```bash
bash release.sh bump patch                    # Step 1: Auto-bump version (creates 7.0.1)
bash release.sh prepare-release 7.0.1         # Step 2: Create release tag ✅
bash release.sh publish 7.0.1                 # Step 3: Push to GitHub ✅

# Or use the full-release command:
bash release.sh bump patch
bash release.sh full-release 7.0.1            # Does prepare + publish + builds
```

### 3. Added Version Helper

Added a tip to automatically get the current version:

```bash
# Get the current version automatically
VERSION=$(grep '^version = ' pyproject.toml | head -1 | sed 's/version = "\(.*\)"/\1/')
echo "Current version: $VERSION"

# Then use it in commands
bash release.sh prepare-release $VERSION
bash release.sh publish $VERSION
```

## Testing

### Test 1: Missing Argument Handling
```bash
$ bash release.sh prepare-release
❌ Version required
Usage: bash release.sh prepare-release VERSION
```
✅ **Result**: Proper error message instead of crash

### Test 2: Version Extraction
```bash
$ VERSION=$(grep '^version = ' pyproject.toml | head -1 | sed 's/version = "\(.*\)"/\1/')
$ echo $VERSION
7.0.1
```
✅ **Result**: Correctly extracts version

### Test 3: Full Workflow
```bash
$ bash release.sh bump patch
$ VERSION=$(grep '^version = ' pyproject.toml | head -1 | sed 's/version = "\(.*\)"/\1/')
$ bash release.sh prepare-release $VERSION
$ bash release.sh publish $VERSION
```
✅ **Result**: Complete workflow executes successfully

## Files Modified

1. **release.sh** (Lines 1426-1436)
   - Fixed argument handling for `build-exe`, `build-deb`, `prepare-release`, `publish`, and `full-release` commands
   
2. **RELEASE_TUTORIAL.md** (Lines 14-26)
   - Updated quick start example with correct version arguments
   - Added version extraction helper
   
3. **.gitignore** (Line 31)
   - Removed `*.spec` to allow `runner.spec` to be tracked

## Impact

- ✅ No more script crashes on missing arguments
- ✅ Clear, helpful error messages
- ✅ Tutorial now shows correct usage
- ✅ Users can easily extract current version
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible** - All existing valid commands continue to work as before. Only error handling for invalid commands improved.

## Related Enhancements

As part of the release script improvements, the following features were also added:
- Enhanced error handling with rollback capability
- Comprehensive logging to `/tmp/release-*.log`
- Parallel builds support
- New commands: `status`, `clean`, `full-release`
- Environment variables for configuration
- Interactive prompts for safety

See `RELEASE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` for full details.
