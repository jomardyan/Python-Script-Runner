# setup.ps1 - Setup script for Python Script Runner (Windows)
#
# This script:
# 1. Checks Python installation and version
# 2. Creates/activates virtual environment
# 3. Installs necessary dependencies
# 4. Runs setup.py with the chosen option
# 5. Keeps the virtual environment activated in the terminal
#
# Usage:
#   .\setup.ps1
#   OR (to bypass execution policy if needed)
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup.ps1
#
# Note: Run from PowerShell (not CMD)

# Requires PowerShell 5.1 or later (Windows 10+)
#Requires -Version 5.1

# Enable strict mode for better error handling
